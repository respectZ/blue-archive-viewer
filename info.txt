Get character id from
LocalizeCharProfileExcelTable (familynametw + personalnametw)
Should be CharacterExcel, but err?

then
FavorSchedule
for recollection lobby

then events can be found in
ScenarioScriptFavor2ExcelTable

===========
If we have CharacterExcel =>
ID from live2d (DevName) localize into Name, then we can get id.

Loop AcademyFavorScheduleExcelTable, match CharacterId and check if "RewardParcelType" contains MemoryLobby, get the id

find the sequence in ScenarioScriptFavor2ExcelTable that matches the ScenarioScriptGroupId
To find the subtitles, we need to check it in order that contains wa:.
todo: find subtitle that matches Start_Idle_01 => (Find wa:, reverse back that contains st?) (case: mika ch__0069)

Every event = 1 wa
In that case, we need to map, wa
instead of mapping, we use id from BGName ? since it's unique every voiceline

todo: find bgmId?
bgmId is just theme_{bgmId}
update dump.cs from JP since we need updated field, and then generate the fbs
